# Hi, I’m Sebastian 

I’m a full stack engineer who works on real web products with real users.

I help early stage founders, startups, and small teams ship features faster, clean up fragile codebases, and stabilize frontend and backend systems without breaking things.

Most of the work I do is short term and focused. I come in, fix what’s blocking progress, ship what matters, and leave the product in a better state than I met it.

---

## What I work on

- Building frontend applications from existing designs and APIs
- Turning unfinished MVPs into usable products
- Refactoring unstructured or fragile codebases
- Improving performance, reliability, and developer experience
- Integrating APIs and fixing frontend backend issues
- Shipping features safely on live products with users

---

## How I work

- Short, clearly scoped engagements
- Focus on shipping and stability, not over engineering
- Clear boundaries on scope and timelines
- Code that is readable, maintainable, and easy to extend
- Regular progress updates and visible work

---

## Tech I use often

- Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js, APIs, basic backend integrations
- Databases: PostgreSQL
- Infrastructure: AWS
- Tooling: Git, GitHub

(I choose tools based on the problem, not trends.)

## Recent work

- Built the frontend for a habit tracking product using existing designs and APIs
- Worked on an AI powered learning platform used by real users
- Designed and built production ready landing pages and handled deployment

More detailed case studies live on my website.
