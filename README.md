# Hi, I’m Sebastian 

I’m a full stack engineer who works on real web products with real users.

I help early stage founders, startups, and small teams ship features faster, clean up fragile codebases, and fix frontend and backend systems without breaking there product.

Most of the work I do is short term and focused. I come in, fix what’s blocking progress, ship what matters, and leave the product in a better state than I met it.

---

## What I work on

- Building frontend applications from existing designs and APIs
- Turning unfinished MVPs into usable products
- Refactoring unstructured or fragile codebases
- Improving performance, reliability, and developer experience
- Integrating APIs and fixing frontend backend issues
- Shipping features safely on live products with users
